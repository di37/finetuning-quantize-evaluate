== 1 - The LLM Training Pipeline

=== 1.1 Three Stages of LLM Training

Every modern large language model goes through three sequential training stages:

#figure(
  image("../diagrams/12-three-stages-training.png", width: 65%),
  caption: [Three Stages of LLM Training],
)

==== Stage 1: Unsupervised Pre-training

*What it is:* Training a model on massive amounts of unlabeled text data from the internet - documentation, research papers, Common Crawl, Wikipedia, encyclopedias, books in multiple languages.

*Why it is called "self-supervised":* There are no human-provided labels. The label is the next token itself within the text - the model learns to predict the next word given all previous words.

*Objective:* Next-token prediction (language modeling). Because this is performed at enormous scale, it is called _large language modeling_ - this is where the term "LLM" originates.

*Result:* A *base model* (e.g., Llama base, Mistral base, GPT base, DeepSeek base, Gemini base). Base models understand language patterns and have general knowledge, but they cannot follow instructions, maintain conversational tone, or produce structured answers.

*Infrastructure requirements:* Massive Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) clusters, trillions of tokens of data, weeks to months of training. This stage is a bottleneck - only well-resourced companies (Meta, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek) can afford it.

*Practical implication:* As practitioners, we do not perform pre-training from scratch. We take existing base models and fine-tune them.

==== Stage 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

SFT can be analyzed along two dimensions:

*A. Parameter Level - How many parameters we train:*

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    align: left,
    stroke: 0.4pt + luma(200),
    fill: (_, row) => if row == 0 { rgb("#1a5276").lighten(85%) } else if calc.odd(row) { rgb("#f5f8fc") } else { white },

  kind: table,

*B. Data Level - How we prepare the training data:*

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 4,
    align: left,
    stroke: 0.4pt + luma(200),
    fill: (_, row) => if row == 0 { rgb("#1a5276").lighten(85%) } else if calc.odd(row) { rgb("#f5f8fc") } else { white },
    table.header([*Type*], [*Data Format*], [*Purpose*], [*Output Style*]),
    [*Non-instructional Fine-tuning*], [Plain text (PDFs, documents, txt files)], [Domain adaptation - teach the model domain-specific language, terminology, vocabulary], [Produces text continuously; not necessarily capable of following instructions],
    [*Instructional Fine-tuning*], [Input/output pairs (instruction + response)], [Teach the model to follow instructions and generate structured answers], [Direct, helpful, structured answers],
  ),
  caption: [Data-Level Fine-Tuning Types],
  kind: table,
)

*Why non-instructional fine-tuning matters:* Before teaching a model to answer questions about a domain, the model should first understand the domain's language. Most YouTube tutorials skip this step. The recommended workflow is:

#figure(
  image("../diagrams/13-finetuning-workflow.png", width: 65%),
  caption: [Recommended Fine-Tuning Workflow],
)

*How ChatGPT was built:* OpenAI took the GPT base model, performed instruction fine-tuning on demonstrations written by human labelers (contractors who wrote high-quality prompt-response pairs), then aligned with RLHF using human preference rankings.

==== Stage 3: Preference-Based Alignment

*Purpose:* Align model responses with human preferences - making the model polite, safe, helpful, and aligned with human values.

*Data format:* Pairs of responses ranked by humans (or AI) - chosen vs. rejected responses for a given prompt.

*Two main techniques:*

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 4,
    align: left,
    stroke: 0.4pt + luma(200),
    fill: (_, row) => if row == 0 { rgb("#1a5276").lighten(85%) } else if calc.odd(row) { rgb("#f5f8fc") } else { white },

    [*RLAIF*], [Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback], [Same as RLHF but with AI-generated labels], [Reinforcement learning],
  ),
  caption: [Preference Alignment Techniques],
  kind: table,
)

DPO is the currently preferred technique - it is simpler to implement and does not require a separate reward model.

==== 1.3.1 Decision Framework: Fine-Tuning vs. Alternatives

Before investing in a fine-tuning pipeline, evaluate whether the problem actually requires it. Fine-tuning is a powerful tool, but it is not always the right one — and choosing the wrong approach wastes compute, data engineering effort, and calendar time.

Knowledge changes frequently.], [The problem is about _style_ or _behavior_ (e.g., tone, safety), not _knowledge_. Retrieval latency is unacceptable.], [Days to weeks],
    [*Fine-Tuning*], [You need to change the model's _behavior_ — output format, domain language, safety alignment, response style. The task is well-defined and you have 500+ quality examples. RAG + prompt engineering has been tried and is insufficient.], [You have fewer than ~200 high-quality examples. The knowledge changes weekly (fine-tuning is a snapshot). You need the model to cite sources (RAG is better).], [Weeks],
    [*Pre-Training*], [No existing model covers your language or domain at all (e.g., rare language, highly specialized scientific field with no public data).], [Almost always — use a pre-trained base model instead.], [Months],

*Common anti-patterns (when fine-tuning is the wrong choice):*

- *"The model doesn't know about our product"* #sym.arrow RAG is almost always better here. Product information changes; fine-tuned knowledge is frozen at training time.
- *"We want the model to always respond in JSON"* #sym.arrow Try constrained decoding (Outlines, Instructor, vLLM guided decoding) or structured output APIs first. This is cheaper and more reliable than fine-tuning for format compliance alone.
- *"We have 50 examples"* #sym.arrow This is too few for meaningful fine-tuning. Invest in prompt engineering with few-shot examples, or generate synthetic training data to reach 500+ examples before fine-tuning.
- *"We want better accuracy on a benchmark"* #sym.arrow If the benchmark is contaminated or the improvement is marginal, fine-tuning may be overfitting to the test set rather than genuinely improving capability.

#blockquote[
  *Rule of thumb:* Try prompt engineering first (hours), then RAG (days), then fine-tuning (weeks). Each subsequent approach requires more investment but solves problems the previous one cannot. Fine-tuning is the right choice when you've exhausted the cheaper alternatives and need to change the model's fundamental behavior, not just its knowledge.

=== 1.6 Section Summary

The LLM training pipeline consists of three stages: (1) unsupervised pre-training for general intelligence, (2) supervised fine-tuning for instruction following and domain adaptation, and (3) preference alignment for human-value alignment. For enterprise use, we skip pre-training and instead take a base model, perform non-instructional fine-tuning for domain knowledge, instructional fine-tuning for structured output, and DPO for preference alignment.
